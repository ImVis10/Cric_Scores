# Cric_Scores
Database Systems lab project - 4th semester (undergrad)

As a part of our database systems project developed an application with Java Swings, applets as the frontend, and MySQL as the database.

While watching the cricket tournaments during my undergrad days, realized we were still using a scoreboard that is operated manually. Knowing the need, I along with my dear friend Sandeep decide to make a digital version of the scoreboard that can be used for cricket tournaments.

The application also includes a myriad of features like maintaining the schedule of matches, player profiles & statistics, etc.
